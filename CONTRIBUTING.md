## Contributing to Coffee-web

Thanks for your interest in contributing! We welcome improvements, bug fixes, and design updates.

How to contribute

1. Fork the repository or clone it if you have write access.
2. Create a descriptive branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature` or `fix/issue-123`.
3. Make small, focused commits with clear messages.
4. Run the site locally to verify visual changes.
5. Open a Pull Request (PR) with a clear description of the change and screenshots for UI updates.

Guidelines

- Keep each PR focused on a single logical change.
- Update `README.md` if filenames or site structure change.
- Use semantic HTML and keep CSS organized in `style.css`.
- Ensure images are optimized for web (reasonable resolution and file size).
- If you add JavaScript, keep it modular and unobtrusive.

Reporting issues

- Use the repository Issues to report bugs or request features.
- Provide steps to reproduce, browser/OS, and any console errors.

Code style

- HTML: valid, semantic tags where appropriate.
- CSS: follow existing conventions in `style.css` and add comments for new sections.
- JS: plain JavaScript is preferred; keep code documented and readable.

Thanks — your contributions make this project better!
